                    <h2>NOTE that I am a solo esthetician meaning I have a single office suite, if someone else opens
                        the main door for you please wait in the lobby until I come get you, don’t come into the suite
                        unless directed to do so for respect and privacy of other guests that may be getting a service
                        before you.</h2>
                    <h2>The main doors are locked at all times so I will need to come get you, when you arrive please
                        text me (preferred) if you call and I don’t pick up, it is because I am still with another
                        client. You may wait outside the building or in your car until I am ready for you.</h2>
                    <h2>You can park in the front, or back of the building, there are entrances at both, just text me
                        which entrance you are at so I can get you at the right place. This will be the protocol for
                        every appointment. (Parking is free :)</h2>
                    <h2>I accept cash, but I do not carry change with me so it must be the exact amount :)</h2>

                must fill out consent forms to get serviced.</h2>
            <h2>Come with no makeup on if possible, if makeup is on it will be removed by the esthetician.</h2>
            <h2>Skip any strong at-home facial treatments the week before your appointment (actives such as
                retinols/retinoids, acids, etc) and any exfoliation treatments a few days prior.</h2>

                and after your facial.</h2>

                your freshly cleansed face).</h2>
